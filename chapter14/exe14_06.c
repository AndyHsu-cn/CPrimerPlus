 * 
 *  A text file holds information about a softball team. Each line has data arranged as
 *  follows:

    4 Jessie Joybat 5 2 1 1
 *  he first item is the player's number, conveniently in the range 0â€“18. The second
 *  item is the player's first name, and the third is the player's last name. Each name
 *  is a single word. The next item is the player's official times at bat, followed by the
 *  number of hits, walks, and runs batted in (RBIs). The file may contain data for
 *  more than one game, so the same player may have more than one line of data,
 *  and there may be data for other players between those lines. Write a program
 *  that stores the data into an array of structures. The structure should have
 *  members to represent the first and last names, the at bats, hits, walks, and RBIs
 *  (runs batted in), and the batting average (to be calculated later). You can use the
 *  player number as an array index. The program should read to end-of-file, and it
 *  should keep cumulative totals for each player.
 *  The world of baseball statistics is an involved one. For example, a walk or 
 *  reaching base on an error doesn't count as an at-bat but could possibly produce
 *  an RBI. But all this program has to do is read and process the data file, as
 *  described next, without worrying about how realistic the data is.
 *  The simplest way for the program to proceed is to initialize the structure contents
 *  to zeros, read the file data into temporary variables, and then add them to the
 *  contents of the corresponding structure. After the program has finished reading
 *  the file, it should then calculate the batting average for each player and store it in
 *  the corresponding structure member. The batting average is calculated by 
 *  dividing the cumulative number of hits for a player by the cumulative number of
 *  at-bats; it should be a floating-point calculation. The program should then display
 *  the cumulative data for each player along with a line showing the combined
 *  statistics for the entire team.
