 * 
 *  Write a program that reads characters from the standard input to end-of-file. For
 *  each character, have the program report whether it is a letter. If it is a letter, also
 *  report its numerical location in the alphabet. For example, c and C would both be
 *  letter 3. Incorporate a function that takes a character as an argument and returns
 *  the numerical location if the character is a letter and that returns â€“1 otherwise.
